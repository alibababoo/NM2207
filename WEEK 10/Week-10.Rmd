WEEK 9:
1. Topic: The popularity of different Taylor Swift songs.

2. I will be using this dataset https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jarredpriester/taylor-swift-spotify-dataset
(This data tells me about the popularity of Taylor Swift's songs, the release dates, length of the songs, valence of the songs, the album of the respective songs and much more)

WEEK 10:
1. Why are Taylor Swift's songs so popular?

2. This is an important question as:
   a. Taylor Swift is one of the most popular contemporary singer today. In 2019, she has already made history as the most awarded artist of all time at American Music Awards, beating Michael Jackson's record of 24 all-time wins. She definetely also has a myriad of other awards under her belt at just 33 years old. (Information from:https://ew.com/awards/2019/11/24/taylor-swift-beats-michael-jackson-american-music-awards-history/)
   b. Taylor Swift constantly pushes out songs extremely loved by international fans. On the US Billboard Hot 100, as of July 2023, Swift is the female musician with the most charted songs, most top-40 songs, most top-20 songs, most top-10 songs, and most number-one debuts. (Information from: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_singles_discography#:~:text=On%20the%20US%20Billboard%20Hot,%2Done%20debuts%20(5).)
   c. Taylor Swift has been an extremely important and well-loved singer for a long time. Her single "Tim McGraw" of her first album was her first Hot 100-charting song, which debuted all the way back in Sept. 23, 2006. (Information from: https://www.billboard.com/artist/taylor-swift/)
   
3. I will use columns A-D, H-R of the dataset to answer the question, 'Why are Taylor Swift's songs so popular?'. They are data about the name, album,	release_date,	track_number, acousticness,	danceability,	energy,	instrumentalness,	liveness,	loudness,	speechiness,	tempo	valence	popularity, and	duration_ms.

   The challenges I faced was mainly thinking about how I can use the dataset to answer why Taylor Swift's songs are    so popular, as this seemed like a question that could be answered by qualitative data instead of quantitive data.    However, after consulting the TAs, I decided that I would analyse her songs that have a popularity rating of 80     and above based on column Q, 63 songs in total.
